Hi there, I am Wenjie Zhang (Chinese name: 张文捷). I graduated from the School of Mechanical and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences with a bachelor’s degree, and I am currently a third-year Master’s student  from the Hangzhou Institute for Technology, Xidian University, under the supervision of Prof. [Bobo Xi](https://b-xi.github.io).

My master’s research primarily focused on Hyperspectral Image Open-Set Recognition (HSI-OSR). Currently, I am extending my work to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Reinforcement Learning.
